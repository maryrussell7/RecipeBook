4 large eggs, room temperature}{
Preheat oven to 400${}^{\circ}$F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. In a mixing bowl, whisk dry ingredients together. Set aside. In medium saucepan over medium high heat, bring water and butter to a boil. Once it is boiling, pour all of the dry ingredients in at once and stir until the dry ingredients are fully incorporated and the mixture looks similar to play dough. Place hot dough in bowl and beat on medium high speed for a minute or two to cool the dough down a bit. With the mixer on medium speed, add one egg at a time, beating after each egg until it is fully incorporated. Once all 4 eggs have been added, mix on medium high speed for 1 minute until the dough is smooth. Use a 2 Tbsp cookie scoop to place dough onto prepared baking sheet, leaving about 2 inches between cream puffs. Use your fingers, dipped in water, to smooth the tops of the cream puffs. Bake for 30 minutes. Turn off oven, open door and pierce each cream puff with a sharp knife. This allows steam to escape, giving a nice crisp cream puff. Leave cream puffs in oven with the door open a few inches, until the oven has cooled completely. These are best served the same day.  \par
Note:  The unbaked cream puffs can be frozen and baked later.  Allow frozen cream puffs to come to room temperature before baking (about 15 minutes).}
